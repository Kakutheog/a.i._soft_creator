### **Step 1: Project Initialization**

**1. Choose Programming Language and Framework**

Since you're aiming for cross-platform GUI support and using Visual Studio Code on Windows 11, **Python with PySide6** is an excellent choice. PySide6 allows you to create native applications with Python, utilizing the Qt framework for the GUI.

**2. Create Project Directory**

- **Create a Root Directory:**
    - Open a terminal or command prompt.
    - Navigate to the location where you want to place your project.
    - Create a new directory:
        

```bash
mkdir AI_Coding_Assistant
```


- Navigate into the directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd AI_Coding_Assistant
    ```
    


**3. Set Up Directory Structure**

- Within the root directory, create the following folders:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir src
    mkdir assets
    mkdir docs
    ```
    

    
    - `src/` - This will contain your source code.
    - `assets/` - Place any images, icons, or other asset files here.
    - `docs/` - For documentation related to the project.
