AI-powered software development tool designed to streamline the coding process.

This document outlines the architecture of an AI-powered software development tool designed to streamline the coding process. The tool leverages a conversational interface powered by a multilingual coding AI, enabling users to generate code and software structures through natural language instructions. This software distinguishes itself by its commitment to utilizing solely free and open-source tools, documentation, and resources in its creation and operation.

## System Overview

Our software comprises two main parts:

1.  **AI Chat Interface:** This conversational interface enables users to interact with the AI using natural language. Users can input requests, instructions, or questions, and the AI will process them to generate code snippets or provide explanations.

2.  **Multi-Tab Interface:** This interface visually organizes the project through three tabs:

    -   **Code Generation View:** This tab provides transparency by letting users observe the AI generating code in real time.
    -   **File Explorer:** This tab functions like a standard file system, displaying the project's files and folders created by the AI. This allows for easy navigation and access.
    -   **Software Preview:** This tab offers a live preview of the developing software as the AI generates code. This enables immediate feedback on UI elements and functionality.

## Functionality

The AI can directly create files and folders on the user's computer in a designated location. Using its knowledge of programming languages and best practices, it generates clean, efficient, and functional code.

## Core Technologies

This AI software combines natural language processing, machine learning, and coding expertise. This fusion automates and accelerates software development, allowing users to focus on high-level design and logic while the AI handles technical implementation details.

## Open-Source Integration

To leverage the power of open-source, the AI assistant will integrate with free and open-source services, APIs, tools, and resources. This includes incorporating services from GitHub repositories, Hugging Face's datasets and models, and potentially other relevant sources like:

1. Gmail
2. GitHub
3. Hugging Face
4. OpenRouter
5. Groq
6. Prodia
7. Stablehorde
8. Claude
9. Tavily
10. Upstash
11. Elevenlabs
12. ScraperAPI
13. Scrapingbee
14. X (Twitter)
15. Figma
16. Together.ai
17. Serper
18. Qdrant
19. MindsDB
20. Supabase
21. Konghq
22. Astra.datastax & Langflow

These integrations will be prioritized based on their relevance to the software's functionality.
