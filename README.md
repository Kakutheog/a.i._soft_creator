## Introduction

The **AI Coding Assistant** is a desktop application that leverages AI models to assist developers in generating code, exploring files, and previewing software components. It provides a conversational interface where users can input requests, and the AI responds with code suggestions or snippets.

## Features

- **AI Chat Interface**: Interact with the AI assistant using natural language.
- **Code Generation View**: View and edit code generated by the AI with syntax highlighting.
- **File Explorer**: Navigate and manage your project files within the application.
- **Software Preview**: Live preview of the software or UI components being developed.
- **Integration with GitHub**: Version control integration for seamless collaboration.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Git**

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI_Coding_Assistant.git
```



2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
    
    ```bash
    cd AI_Coding_Assistant
    ```
    

    
3. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
    
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    

    
    - **Activate Virtual Environment**
        
        - On Windows:
            
            ```bash
            venv\Scripts\activate
            ```
            
    
            
        - On macOS/Linux:
            
            ```bash
            source venv/bin/activate
            ```
            
    
            
4. **Install Dependencies**
    
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    

    
5. **Configure Environment Variables**
    
    - **Create a `.env` File**
        
         
        
        In the project root directory, create a file named `.env`. This file will store your API keys and credentials.
        
    - **Add the Necessary Variables**
        
        ```env
        # GitHub Credentials
        GITHUB_USERNAME=your_github_username
        GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
        
        # Hugging Face Credentials
        HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=your_hugging_face_token
        
        # Add other API keys as needed
        ```
        

        
        **Note**: Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials. Do not share or commit this file to version control.
        
6. **Run the Application**
    
    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```
